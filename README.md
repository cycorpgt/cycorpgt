# 👋 Hi, I’m Cy Williamson

I'm the co-founder of [Bangun.AI](https://github.com/cycorpgpt/bangunai-mvp) — an AI infrastructure platform simplifying construction cost estimation across Southeast Asia.

🏗️ We help developers, contractors, Architects and other construction professionals turn blueprint files into:
- BOQs (Bill of Quantities)
- Cost Estimates
- Proposal Documents

Built using:
- 🧠 100% in house
- 📊 Full stack architecture
- 🌏 Regional material datasets (Indonesia + SEA)

🚀 Backed by **Antler VC**

Currently testing our MVP with early adopters across Indonesia.  
Looking to connect with investors, accelerators, and collaborators in construction tech, AI infra, and frontier markets.
